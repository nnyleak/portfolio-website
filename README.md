- simple nav between project pages
- static project entries (manually added for now)

## ᯓ★ tech stack
- html
- css

## ᯓ★ notes
this is a beginner version of my portfolio. i made it as a starting point and for practice, just to have somewhere i can showcase my work. i plan to expand and refine it as i grow.

## ᯓ★ future improvements
- make project pages dynamic (no more manual creation)
- responsive layout, animations + transitions for smoother browsing
- possibly rebuild with react or another framework to scale
