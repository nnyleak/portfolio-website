# kae's portfolio
this site serves as my personal portfolio website where i show any projects, experiments and ongoing work as a game designer + web developer!<br>
built with **html**, **css**, and **javascript**.

## (current) features
- simple layout with html + css (non-responsive)
- simple nav between project pages
- static project entries (manually added for now)

## tech stack
- html
- css
- javascript

## notes
this is a beginner version of my portfolio. i made it as a starting point and for practice, just to have somewhere i can showcase my work. i plan to expand and refine it as i grow.

## future improvements
- make project pages dynamic (no more manual creation)
- responsive layout, animations + transitions for smoother browsing
- possibly rebuild with react or another framework to scale
